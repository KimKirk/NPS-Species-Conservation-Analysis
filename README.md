# NPS-Species-Conservation-Analysis
- National Park Service Species Conservation Analysis

- Government: United States Department of the Interior - Ecology

- Descriptive and inferential data analyses were performed on the conservation statuses of endangered species across National Parks in the United States. 5,824 rows were imported, cleaned, and analyzed. Analysis of conservation statuses was conducted to investigate if there are any patterns to the types of species that become endangered. Analysis of the hoof and mouth disease program was conducted to identify required sample size to test for program effectiveness.

- 5824 rows of data set that includes 4 features.

## Processing Instructions:
- To improve reproducibility of the data analysis, a Jupyter Notebook file and data source are included.

## Steps to Transformation:
- [Data download](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/intro-data-analysis/biodiversity.zip)
- File “species.csv” was imported into Jupyter Notebook.
- Identify number of different species, categories, and conservation statuses.
- Re-code NA values to 'No Intervention' for ease of readability and analysis.
- Recode values into categories "protected" and "not protected".
- Calculated percentage "protected" category.
- File “observations.csv” was imported into Jupyter Notebook.
- Merged dataframes for Mammal species of Sheep observations across 7 days for each national park.
- Identified significance of likelihood for endangered conservation status between species.
- Identified required sample size for testing special intervention program for hoof and mouth disease.
